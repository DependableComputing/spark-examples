Mostly Working Pieces of Polygon Merge
--------------------------------------

There's not a lot here and it doesn't all fully prove, but we're not surprised
that the segment intersection code for `segments_2d` doesn't prove because of
the nonlinear arithmetic that's required. 

We had other mostly-working bits for polygons, but the functions implemented
there have migrated elsewhere or should be subsumed by the later work that we
did on `integer_arrays` (taking that as a template for `point_2d_arrays`).
